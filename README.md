# Cyber-Security-Bootcamp-Project-1

Repository for the important items of my first DU Cybersecurity Bootcamp Project

## Description of files contained in this repository

The files you see listed here are a mixture of configurations files that have been modified to allow the network to function as desired and 
YAML files that configured the machines with the proper Docker conatiners. There is also a diagram of the network that can be viewed to see 
exactly how the network is laid out.
